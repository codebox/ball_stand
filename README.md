# Ball Stand

This project contains a SCAD file defining a 3D model of a ball-stand, useful for displaying the clear acrylic balls often used for contact juggling. The model consists of 3 rings connected together to form an equilateral triangle. Each ring has a concave indentation on top, shaped to exactly fit a sphere of a certain diameter. The rings are spaced so that when spheres of the correct size are placed into them, they touch to form a triangle.

The 'stl_files' folder contains pre-rendered STL files suitable for 3D printing, for a range of common diameters:

* [60mm]()
* [2.5 inches]()
* [65mm]()
* [70mm]()
* [75mm]()
* [3 inches]()
* [80mm]()
* [85mm]()
* [90mm]()

Maybe this will be useful to someone - I've made a 3D-printable model of a ball-stand, perfect for displaying acrylic contact juggling balls. I got a few printed up and they work great, so I'm open sourcing the design in case anyone else wants it. There are ready-made STL files for most of the common contact-ball sizes, and the source code is available as well for the technically inclined.
